# Coderscave Internship

This repository contains the tasks completed during the internship at Coderscave. It includes various machine learning projects such as spam mail detection, mobile price classification, and data analysis using datasets like Google Play Store reviews and mobile data.

## Tasks & Files

### 1. **Task 1: Basic Machine Learning**
   - A beginner-level machine learning task using Python and scikit-learn.
   - **File**: `Coders Cave Task 1 .ipynb`

### 2. **Task 2: Spam Mail Detection**
   - A classification model to detect spam and ham emails using machine learning techniques.
   - **File**: `CodersCave Task 2 Spam Mail detection.ipynb`
   - Dataset: `spam_ham_dataset.csv`

### 3. **Task 3: Mobile Price Classification**
   - A machine learning model to classify mobile phone prices using features like battery, screen size, and brand.
   - **File**: `Task 3 ,Mobile Price classification using Machine Learning .ipynb`
   - Datasets: `googleplaystore.csv`, `googleplaystore_user_reviews.csv`, `train.csv`, `test.csv`
